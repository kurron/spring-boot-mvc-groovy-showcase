= Foo API Guide

== Overview

The Foo API allows you to fetch information about items that have been published within the system.
The API adheres as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions, making writing applications easy.
The API uses the {hal-link}[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)] as its
interchange format, providing an excellent medium for applications to consume the information and providing
a robust mechanism to handle any changing URLs.

=== Foo Resource Structure
Each foo will take the following form. To keep the document readable, these fields will not be
discussed anywhere else.
